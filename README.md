# ESP32 Misc. Projects - 2022
This is the project code for various mini-projects written in ESP-IDF for an [Adafruit HUZZAH32 ESP32 Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather) microcontroller. This code was written for my undergrad Smart and Connected Systems class, in collaboration with George Kent-Scheller and Spencer Piligian. There are many projects/snippets included within this repo, for various mechanical/electronic systems designed by the three collaborators. Highlights include: an autonomous fish feeder, IOT voting fobs, several NodeJS webservers, and a self-driving, cruise-controlled car with turn indicators, horn with custom sound, and too many high-power draw range sensors. These projects are buildable using ESP-IDF, but have been consolidated into one folder without extraneous project files, and thus require tinkering to deploy. My contributions include much of the embedded code, some of the web code, and some electronics design.
